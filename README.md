# Spring Boot Kotlin Authentication API

## Overview
This project demonstrates secure, token-based authentication built using Spring Boot, Kotlin, and JWT. The application is **running on a free-tier EC2 instance**, and it supports essential authentication operations such as user registration, login, password reset, and updating user information. Additionally, an Actuator server is available on port `8090` for monitoring and managing the application.

## Features
- **User Registration:** Register new users with email, password, and personal details.
- **Login:** Authenticate users via email and password, and generate JWT tokens for secure access.
- **Password Reset:** Send password reset tokens to user emails.
- **Update User Info:** Modify user details using the user ID.
- **JWT-based Security:** Protect API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **User Management:** List all users, read individual user details, and delete users by ID.
- **Actuator Support:** Monitor application health and performance using Spring Boot Actuator on port `8090`.
